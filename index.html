                It is an instrument used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. Geiger counter is widely used in applications 
                such as radiation dosimetry, radiological protection, experimental physics and nuclear industry. Depending on the 
                configuration it can detect alpha, beta particles, X-rays and gamma rays, using the ionization effect produced in Geiger-Muller 
                tube.

            <p>
                A Geiger counter consists of a Geiger-Muller tube and processing electronics. The tube is filled with an inert gas, for 
                example, helium, neon or argon and there is a thin tungsten wire. The gass is filled at a low pressure, to which a high 
                voltage is aplied. When radiation enters the tube, it causes ionization, splitting gas molecules into ions and electrons. 
                The electrons, being negatively charged, are instantly attracted by the high-voltage positive wire and as they zoom through 
                the tube collide with more gas molecules and produce further ionization. The result is that lots of electrons suddenly arrive 
                at the wire, producing a pulse of electricity that can be measured on a meter.

                <ol>
                    <li>Relatively cheap, either when manufactured in the laboratory or as a commercially available component</li>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                German physicist Hans Geiger (1882–1945) developed the idea in 1912 while working with Ernest Rutherford, the 
                physicist who "split the atom" (proved experimentally that atoms consisted of other, smaller particles). Back in 
                Germany, sixteen years later, Geiger greatly improved the instrument with the help of a colleague named Walter Müller,
                 which is why Geiger counters are often called Geiger-Müller counters (or Geiger-Müller tubes).
